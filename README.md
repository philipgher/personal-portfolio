This is a simple website that links to some projects I have worked on.

The background of the website is a place for experimentation, it currently shows some dynamic clouds rendered using SVG filters. Each time you refresh it will be slightly different. If your computer can handle it - the clouds will animate.

Check it out on www.philipghering.nl
